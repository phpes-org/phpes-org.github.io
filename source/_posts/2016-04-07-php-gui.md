[PHP-GUI](https://github.com/gabrielrcouto/php-gui) é um projeto experimental que permite criar programas com interface gráfica nativa do desktop do usuário sem a necessidade de extensões adicionais.

>PHP can be more than a "Web Language", it's a fast language, with a cross platform interpreter and a good CLI. GUI is a natural step for completing this ecosystem.
>
>For many years, GUI projects are being developed for PHP, like PHP-GTK, PHP-QT, wxPHP and so many others, but none of them became popular.
