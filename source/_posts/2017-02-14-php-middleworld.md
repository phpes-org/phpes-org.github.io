[PHP Middleworld](http://www.php-middleworld.com/) é um site que facilita a busca por implementações de middleware da [PSR-7](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) para serem utilizados em frameworks compatíveis.

>What is middleware?
>
>In the realm of web application development Middleware refers to functions wrapped around business logic. They rely upon the decorator pattern and are composed in a sort of layered stack. You could think of them as onion layers, with your business logic residing at the innermost stratum (more on Wikipedia).
>
>Several modern PHP frameworks (such as Zend Expressive and Slim) embrace such framework-agnostic, reuse-oriented paradigm, wholly supporting PSR-7 compliant middleware.
>
>Goal for PHP Middleworld is collecting all available PSR-7 compliant middleware and provide a unique, consistent repository, encouraging middleware reuse and exchange among PHP developers.
