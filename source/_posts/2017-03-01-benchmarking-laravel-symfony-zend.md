Post (inglês) demonstrando um benchmark entre os frameworks [Laravel](https://laravel.com), [Symfony](https://symfony.com) e [Zend](https://framework.zend.com).

> A variety of benchmarks comparing PHP frameworks float around the web. However, they are often comparing “apples” to “oranges”. In particular, I want to focus on Laravel, Symfony, and Zend and why these three frameworks are often benchmarked incorrectly against each other.
